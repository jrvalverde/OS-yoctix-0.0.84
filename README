How to build a test-boot-floppy    (this works most of the time)
----------------------------------------------------------------

	The following should work on OpenBSD/i386 and similar systems:

	1.  Create an ffs or msdosfs filesystem on a (formatted) floppy.

	2.  Mount the floppy onto the "bootdisk" directory.

	3.  'make boot'

	4.  Place additional files on the floppy, such as pdksh (/bin/sh)
	    or ls.  (These are not included in the Yoctix source tree.)

	5.  umount the floppy.

	6.  Now a new bootsector needs to be written to the floppy. There are
	    some variants of "burnkernel" in src/MISC. Note that for example
	    the msdosfs burnkernel doesn't understand ffs filesystems and vice
	    versa.
