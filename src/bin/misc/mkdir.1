.SH NAME
mkdir \- create directories
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.BI "mkdir [-p] [-m mode] " dirname " [" ... "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR mkdir
creates directories using permission 0777, modified by the
current umask value. Available options are:
.TP
\f3\-p\f1
Create all intermediate directories required to reach
.BR dirname .
The target directory is allowed to already exist with the -p option
without causing an error.
.TP
\f3\-m mode\f1
Sets permission to
.BR mode
instead of 0777. The value will still be modified by the
current umask value. This option does not modify the permission
used on intermediate directories created with -p.
.TP
.BR mkdir
returns 0 on success, 1 on failure.
.SH BUGS
Doesn't handle permission modes correctly... (?)
